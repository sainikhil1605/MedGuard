The platform will serve as a decentralized health record storage system where users can store their medical data securely and grant access to healthcare providers as needed.
The platform will serve as a decentralized health record storage system where users can store their medical data securely and grant access to healthcare providers as needed. The blockchain ensures that the records are immutable and only accessible to authorized individuals.

Key Features:
Decentralized Health Record Storage:

Store health records (e.g., prescriptions, medical history, lab results, scans) on the blockchain.
Patients retain full control over their data and can grant or revoke access to healthcare providers at any time.
Data Privacy and Security:

Using blockchain encryption, only the patient and authorized personnel can view the records.
Immutable logs for access recordsâ€”ensuring transparency on who accessed the data and when.
Smart Contracts for Authorization:

Implement smart contracts to automate access control. For example, when a patient gives access to a doctor, the smart contract enforces time-limited access with proper logging.
Interoperability with Healthcare Providers:

Integrate with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems for seamless data sharing between healthcare institutions, making it easier for patients to share their records across multiple providers.
Mobile Access:

Allow patients to manage their records and permissions via a mobile app, offering easy access to view, share, or update their health data.
Health Tokenization for Data Sharing:

Tokenize health data for research purposes. Patients can share anonymized data with researchers in exchange for tokens or rewards, helping with medical studies.
Technical Details:
1. Blockchain Architecture
Blockchain Network: You can use a permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) to ensure that only verified healthcare institutions and patients are part of the network.
Data Storage: Store encrypted health records off-chain (e.g., using IPFS or cloud storage), and save hash values of these records on-chain to ensure immutability and data integrity.
Access Control: Use smart contracts for access control, allowing patients to define who can access their records and under what conditions (e.g., for a specific time period or specific types of data).
2. Smart Contracts for Access Permissions
User-Centric Access: Each patient has a personal smart contract that manages access permissions.
Access Requests: When a healthcare provider needs access, the patient can approve or deny the request. The approval triggers a smart contract that grants access for a defined period.
Revoke Access: The smart contract can be terminated at any time by the patient, instantly revoking access to the health records.
3. Data Encryption
Encrypt patient data before storing it off-chain to ensure that no one but the authorized party can read the data.
Use asymmetric encryption (public/private keys) where the patient holds the private key to decrypt the health records, and the healthcare provider gets temporary access to the decryption key via the smart contract.
4. Interoperability
Use FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) to ensure compatibility with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.
Build an API layer that healthcare institutions can integrate with to seamlessly request and retrieve patient records from the blockchain.
5. Mobile App
Develop a cross-platform mobile app (using React Native or Flutter) where patients can:
Upload medical records (via a secure portal).
Grant/revoke access to healthcare providers.
View access logs.
Share anonymized data for research purposes (optional).
Tech Stack:
Backend:
Blockchain: Hyperledger Fabric (for permissioned networks) or Ethereum (for a more public network).
Smart Contracts: Solidity (Ethereum) or Chaincode (Hyperledger).
Storage: IPFS or AWS S3 for storing encrypted health records off-chain.
API Layer: Node.js or Python for building REST APIs to interact with healthcare providers.
Frontend:
Mobile App: React Native or Flutter for a cross-platform mobile app that allows patients to manage their records.
Web Interface: React.js for a web portal where healthcare providers can request access to patient records.
Encryption Libraries: Use cryptography libraries like Web3.js or ethers.js to handle encryption/decryption and blockchain interactions.
